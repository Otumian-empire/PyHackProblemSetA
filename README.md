PyHack Problem Set A

1 - Write a function that checks whether the individual digits of a number is odd or even or zero

2 - Find all odd Fibonacci numbers starting from 3 to 1000

3 - Write a function to find the sum of the individual digits of a number and check whether 
it's prime

4 - Write a function that checks whether a given number is a palindrome or not. Single digits are omitted

5 - print from 1 to N:
When input = 5
output = 1,2,3,4,5
When input = 9
output = 1,2,3,4,...,9

6 - collatz:
Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. If number is even, then 
collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value. If number is odd, then collatz() should print 
and return 3 * number + 1.
Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps calling collatz() on that 
number until the function returns the value 1. NB: // is floor division

7 - comma-code:
When given input as , spam = ['python', 'django', 'tensoflow', 'tkinter']
Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns 
a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with 
and inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous 
spam list to the function would return 'python', 'django', 'tensoflow' and 'tkinter'.
But your function should be able to work with any list value passed to it.

8 - fizz buzz:
write a function named fizzbuzz() that has one parameter named numrange.
Imagine a series of a number from 1 to numrange.
1 2 3 4 5 6, ..., numrange
Fizz and Buzz refer to any number that's a multiple of 3 and 5 respectively. In other words, if a number is divisible
by 3, it is substituted with fizz; if a number is divisible by 5, it is substituted with buzz. If a number is simultaneously
a multiple of 3 AND 5, the number is replaced with "fizz buzz." In essence, it emulates the famous children game
"fizz buzz

9 - Write a function that when given a digit it reverses it
when input = 1234
output = 4321

10 - Write a function to find the first 100 factorial numbers that are both multiples of 3 and 6

11 - Implement the ceasar ciper: http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/
Must have two functions, encryptc(plaintext) and decryptc(encryptedtext)

12 - Write a function to find:
  a - the sum of the square of the first 20 even numbers
  b - the square of the sum of the first 20 even numbers
