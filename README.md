PyHack Problem Set A

1 - leap year: 

2 - print sum of N integers:
When input = 5
output = 15
When input = 9
output = 45

3 - factorial:
When input = 5
otuput = 120
When input = 9
output = 362880

4 - sumtorial:
When input = 5
output = 15
When input = 9
output = 45
Number 4 is the same as 2. In for, make use of recursion

5 - print from 1 to N:
When input = 5
output = 1,2,3,4,5
When input = 9
output = 1,2,3,4,...,9

6 - collatz:
Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. If number is even, then 
collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value. If number is odd, then collatz() should print 
and return 3 * number + 1.
Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps calling collatz() on that 
number until the function returns the value 1. NB: // is floor division

7 - comma-code:
When given input as , spam = ['python', 'django', 'tensoflow', 'tkinter']
Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns 
a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with 
and inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous 
spam list to the function would return 'python', 'django', 'tensoflow' and 'tkinter'.
But your function should be able to work with any list value passed to it.

8 - fizz buzz:
write a function named fizzbuzz() that has one parameter named numrange.
Imagine a series of a number from 1 to numrange.
1 2 3 4 5 6, ..., numrange
Fizz and Buzz refer to any number that's a multiple of 3 and 5 respectively. In other words, if a number is divisible
by 3, it is substituted with fizz; if a number is divisible by 5, it is substituted with buzz. If a number is simultaneously
a multiple of 3 AND 5, the number is replaced with "fizz buzz." In essence, it emulates the famous children game
"fizz buzz

9 - compute the quadratic formular: https://www.purplemath.com/modules/quadform.htm

10 - temperature conversion: http://www.weatherwizkids.com/temperature-conversion-chart.htm

11 - implement the ceasar ciper: http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/
Must have two functions, encryptc(plaintext) and decryptc(encryptedtext)

**be creative** [document the big picture of the idea if you canâ€™t code it]
